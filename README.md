Both of us have always been interested in developing games, especially as we are avid gamers ourselves. We haved played games that are extremely rewarding, awarding a sense of fulfillment after completion of various milestones in the game (e.g. Stardew Valley, Runescape). While there are creature collection games like Pok√©mon with similar concepts to ours, they are typically developed on other platforms (Nintendo systems) and the mainline games are not made available on mobile platforms.

With the current pandemic situation, we hope our game can serve as a form of distraction for people of all age groups to take some time off and venture into the world of Volarvis.
